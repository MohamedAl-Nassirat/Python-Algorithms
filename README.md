# Python-Algorithms


The purpose of this repo is to track my progress in understanding building general and efficent algorithms.

1: Quick_Sort Algorithm 
  - My first ever algorithm built in python, takes a random sequence and sorts through the array and picks the last 'item' in array to be the pivot, then ranks the 
    numbers in the array comparing to the pivot, if it's greater or smaller, it will be stored. This process is reiterated untill the conditions can't be met, thus 
    concluding that the array has been sorted. 
  - Time Complexity: Î©(n log(n))
  - ToDo: 
      - Visualization
      - Optimization 
      - Random pivot + median of 3 integers, etc
2: Bubble_Sort Algorithm:

  - WIP
